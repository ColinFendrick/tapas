# Tapas

![](./tapas-example.gif)

An example of a website in-progress (that I'll probably never get around to finishing). Built with a basic (very basic) back end from Graph Cool. Some keyframes and CSS were also used.

I put this in to show a work-in-progress, as well as how GraphQL and Graph Cool can be basically implemented.
